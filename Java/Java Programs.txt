#6 - Java Program to find Prime Numbers
Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only. In other words, prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers.
Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. 2 is the only even number that is prime number, because all the other even numbers can be divided by 2

Second number = 12


#14 - Java Program to find duplicate characters in a String
Algorithm
1. Define a string.
2. Two loops will be used to find the duplicate characters. Outer loop will be used to select a character and initialize variable count by 1.
3. Inner loop will compare the selected character with rest of the characters present in the string.
4. If a match found, it increases the count by 1 and set the duplicates of selected character by '0' to mark them as visited.
5. After inner loop, if count of character is greater than 1, then it has duplicates in the string.

#21 - Java Program to Sort Numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is suitable for small data sets.

Example:

#23 - Java Program to Sort Numbers using Selection Sort Algorithm
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1. The subarray which already sorted. 
2. The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. 

Example:  arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}
1st Pass: arr[] = {11, 25, 12, 22, 64}

#25 - Java Program to Sort Numbers using Insertion Sort Algorithm
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Example:  arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}
1st Pass: arr[] = {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}
2nd Pass: arr[] = {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}
3rd Pass: arr[] = {11, 12, 5, 13, 6}
                  {11, 5, 12, 13, 6}
                  {5, 11, 12, 13, 6}
4th Pass: arr[] = {5, 11, 12, 6, 13}
		  {5, 11, 6, 12, 13}
		  {5, 6, 11, 12, 13}
