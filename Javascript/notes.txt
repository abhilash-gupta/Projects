JavaScript Tutorial 1 - Introduction, NodeJS Installation & Hello World Example
- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web
- Must learn language to become a Web Developer

Uses:
HTML - Creating web pages
CSS - Design web pages
JavaScript - Interact with web pages

What is Node.js?
- Node.js is an open source server environment
- It is free to use
- Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
- Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

Install Node.js from link:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

- Editor: VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- Example of How JavaScript works with console.log and script tag








JavaScript Tutorial 2 - Change HTML Content using JavaScript
We can use one of the many JavaScript HTML methods - getElementById(), to get the HTML element.
Than we can update the content of this HTML element as per our requirements









JavaScript Tutorial 3 - DOM Selectors to find HTML Elements in JavaScript
We have multiple DOM selectors that can be used based on your choice:
- getElementById()
- getElementsByClassName()
- getElementsByTagName()
- querySelector()
- querySelectorAll()








JavaScript Tutorial 4 - Output in JavaScript
There are multiple ways to provide output in JavaScript:
- innerHTML
- document.write()
- alert()
- console.log()









JavaScript Tutorial 5 - Exercise: Find sum of Numbers Entered by user in JavaScript
Follow below steps to complete this exercise:
1. Ask user to enter two numbers using input fields in HTML
2. Add both these numbers and display the sum in a div tag







JavaScript Tutorial 6 - Variables in Javascript (var vs let vs const)
Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
- Automatically - [var is used internally]
- Using var - global scope
- Using let [added in 2015] - block scope
- Using const [added in 2015] - block scope

It is a good practice to always declare variables before use.

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.












JavaScript Tutorial 7 - Arithmetic Operators in Javascript
Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers in Javascript:

+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement










JavaScript Tutorial 8 - Assignment Operators in Javascript
Below are some of the Assignment Operators in Javascript:

Operator	Example		Same As
=		x = y		x = y
+=		x += y		x = x + y
-=		x -= y		x = x - y
*=		x *= y		x = x * y
/=		x /= y		x = x / y
%=		x %= y		x = x % y
**=		x **= y		x = x ** y














JavaScript Tutorial 9 - Comparison Operators in Javascript
Below are some of the Comparison Operators in Javascript:

==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator












JavaScript Tutorial 10 - Exercise on Arithmetic Operators in Javascript
Follow below steps to complete this Javascript practice Exercise:

1. Create 2 variables x and y and assign them values of 10 and 5 respectively
2. Print the result of addition of x and y
3. Print the result of subtraction of x and y
4. Print the result of Multiplication of x and y
5. Print the result of Division of x and y
6. Print the result of Remainder of x and y
7. Print the result of x to the power of y
8. Print the result of x greater than y
9. Find results of above operations when x = 5 and y = 11















JavaScript Tutorial 11 - String in Javascript
String is text that can be assigned or stored in variable

Example:
const str = "Programming for Beginners"

- String concatenation using + operator
- Quotes inside quotes in string
- Template Strings with backticks - `
- String length property
- Escape characters in string (", `, \)
- String comparison
- String letters access















JavaScript Tutorial 12 - Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript has 8 Datatypes:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object (array, map, set, date, promises, custom objects and many more)

















JavaScript Tutorial 13 - If and else Conditional Statements in JavaScript
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


















JavaScript Tutorial 14 - Switch Statement in JavaScript
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions

Syntax:
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}



















JavaScript Tutorial 15 - Exercise to Greet Based on time in Javascript
In this exercise, get the current time using javascript date object and greet the person with good morning or good afternoon message
