There are five different position values:

1. static - default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties

2. relative - element is positioned relative to its normal position

3. fixed - element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled

4. absolute - element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

5. sticky - element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work

Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix
















CSS Tutorial #27 - z index Property in CSS
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

An element can have a positive or negative stack order:

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).

















CSS Tutorial #28 - Overflow Property in CSS
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:
1. visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content is displayed outside the element's box
2. hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
3. scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
4. auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary



















CSS Tutorial #29 - float and clear Property in CSS
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content 
Example: let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:
left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

Example - Div Float Next To Each Other

Clear property:
When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

The clear property can have one of the following values:
none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

CSS Tutorial #43 - Length Units in CSS
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Absolute Lengths:
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px 	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1 in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1 in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)


Relative Lengths:
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.

em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*



























CSS Tutorial #44 - Specificity and Priority in CSS

Elements and pseudo-elements
