Below are some of the Basic HTML Tags:

2. <html>
This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by <head>...</head> and document body which is represented by <body>...</body> tags.

3. <head>
This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like <title>, <link> etc.

4. <title>
The <title> tag is used inside the <head> tag to mention the document title.

5. <body>
This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like <h1>, <div>, <p> etc.

6. <h1>
This tag represents the heading.

7. <p>
This tag represents a paragraph.







HTML Tutorial #3 - Heading, Paragraph and Line Break Tags in HTML
Heading Tag:
Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings:
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>

Paragraph Tag:
The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p>

Line Break Tag:
Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them

An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash.

<p>This is paragraph content</p>
<h1>This is heading content</h1> - HTMl ELEMENT
<div>This is division content</div>
<br />

So here <p>....</p> is an HTML element, <h1>...</h1> is another HTML element. There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed, such as <img.../>, <hr /> and <br /> elements. These are known as void elements.









HTML Tutorial #8 - Attributes in HTML
An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts âˆ’ a name and a value

The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph <p> element in the example carries an attribute whose name is title, which you can use to provide hint to the user.

The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations.
