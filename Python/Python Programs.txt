#23 - Python Program to Convert Decimal to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal
The decimal system is the most widely used number system. However, computers only understand binary. Binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems are closely related, and we may require to convert decimal into these systems.

The decimal system is base 10 (ten symbols, 0-9, are used to represent a number) and similarly, binary is base 2, octal is base 8 and hexadecimal is base 16.

A number with the prefix 0b is considered binary, 0o is considered octal and 0x as hexadecimal. For example:

60 = 0b111100 = 0o74 = 0x3c




#24 - Python Program to Find ASCII Value of Character
ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

#25 - Python Program to Find HCF or GCD using Loop
The highest common factor (H.C.F) or greatest common divisor (G.C.D) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that perfectly divides the two given numbers. For example, the H.C.F of 12 and 14 is 2.





#26 - Python Program to Find HCF or GCD using Euclidean algorithm
Euclidean algorithm is based on the fact that H.C.F. of two numbers divides their difference as well.

In this algorithm, we divide the greater number by smaller number and take the remainder. Now, divide the smaller by this remainder. Repeat until the remainder is 0.

For example, if we want to find the H.C.F. of 54 and 24, we divide 54 by 24. The remainder is 6. Now, we divide 24 by 6 and the remainder is 0. Hence, 6 is the required H.C.F.

x = 54, y = 24
x = 24, y = 6 - (54 % 24)
x = 6, y = 0 - (24 % 6)




#27 - Python Program to Find LCM using while loop

Previous program using while loop is slower to run. 
We can make it more efficient by using the fact that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of those two numbers.

Number1 * Number2 = L.C.M. * G.C.D.

L.C.M. = Number1 * Number2 // G.C.D.

#33 - Python Program to Add Two Matrices
In Python, we can implement a matrix as a nested list (list inside a list). We can treat each element as a row of the matrix.

For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. First row can be selected as X[0] and the element in first row, first column can be selected as X[0][0]

[
[1, 2], 
[4, 5], 
[3, 6]
]




#34 - Python Program to Transpose a Matrix
Transpose of a matrix is interchanging of rows and columns.

For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. The first row can be selected as X[0]. And, the element in the first-row first column can be selected as X[0][0].

Transpose is denoted as X'. The element at ith row and jth column in X will be placed at jth row and ith column in X'. So if X is a 3x2 matrix, X' will be a 2x3 matrix.




#35 - Python Program to Multiply Two Matrices
Multiplication of two matrices X and Y is defined only if the number of columns in X is equal to the number of rows Y.

If X is a n x m matrix and Y is a m x l matrix then, XY is defined and has the dimension n x l (but YX is not defined).

#37 - Python Program to Sort numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm
The bubble sort uses a straightforward logic that works by repeating swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in the right order. It compares one pair at a time and swaps if the first element is greater than the second element; otherwise, move further to the next pair of elements for comparison.

Example:
list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]

It compares the first two elements and here 5>3 then swap with each other. Now we get new list is -
[3, 5, 8, 6, 7, 2]

In second comparison, 5 < 8 then swapping happen
[3, 5, 8, 6, 7, 2]

In third comparison, 8>6 then swap
[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2]

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.

1st Pass: list1 = [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]
2nd Pass: list1 = [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]
3rd Pass: list1 = [11, 12, 5, 13, 6]
                  [11, 5, 12, 13, 6]
                  [5, 11, 12, 13, 6]
4th Pass: list1 = [5, 11, 12, 6, 13]

#41 - Python Program to Sort Numbers using Selection Sort Algorithm
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1. The subarray which already sorted. 
2. The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. 

Example:  arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}
1st Pass: arr[] = {11, 25, 12, 22, 64}
2nd Pass: arr[] = {11, 12, 25, 22, 64}
