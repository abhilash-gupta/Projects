Python Project #1 - Number guessing game in Python
Steps to create a Number guessing game Project in Python:

1. Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
2. Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
3. Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses







Python Project #2 - Word Guessing Game in Python
Steps to create Word Guessing Game in Python
1. In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which the interpreter will choose 1 random word. 
2. The user will be asked to guess any alphabet. 
3. If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.

Example:
words = ['rainbow', 'computer', 'science', 'programming',
         'python', 'mathematics', 'player', 'condition',
         'reverse', 'water', 'board', 'geeks']
